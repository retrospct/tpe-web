# Dev Notes

## Blog

### I feel like in a blog youâ€™d have to have these things:

- Blog main publication page with optional sections and filters
  - Sections would be featured (pinned), recent, or popular posts
  - Filters like weddings, corporate, or other

### Blog article page

- Cover Image
- Author profile image, name, and TPE links/socials
- Datestamp w/ last updated
- Rich text content (headings, body text, links, lists, simple quotes, etc)
- Quote callout with optional image and other options
- Related or recent blog posts
- Images (w/ optional captions & photo credits)
  - Single image
  - Side by side image
  - Image gallery
- Vendor credits section (photographers, videographers, etc)
- Newsletter or other email input capture CTA

### Other suggestions

- Share to button (social media posts, copy link, etc.)
- Time to read post estimate
- social media embeds (embed a IG, TikTok, or whatever post or profile)
- likes or hearts counter
- views counter
- comments section
